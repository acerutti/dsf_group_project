The purpose of our data science project is to analyse and predict rental prices of apartments in Switzerland in 2019 based on various features. For this purpose, we use a dataset that we received from Novalytica AG, a real estate data analytics company based in Berne, Switzerland. The dataset was constructed by web-scraping the popular apartment listing platform Comparis. The raw dataset comprises about 100â€™000 observations of 139 variables describing features of the listed accommodation. We first clean the dataset and choose the most meaningful variables. Then we improve on the existing dataset using text analysis. Next, we present the dataset through exploratory data analysis before we use different regression models to predict the rental prices. Finally, we compare and discuss the results obtained.
